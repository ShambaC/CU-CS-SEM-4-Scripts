# CU-CS-SEM-4-Scripts
Algorithms in practical syllabus implemented using C.

## What is this ?
This is a collection of all the programs that are needed for the practical syllabus of BSc Honors Computer Science Calcutta University Semester 4. All the programs have been checked and they work fine.

## Why ?
For student reference.

##What are the programs in it ?
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra Algorithm (in two different ways of implementation)
  - Shows path between two nodes (Dijkstra_Shamba.c)
  - Does not show the path (Dijkstra.c)
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- Warshall algorithm (this is not needed and I am not sure if this is actually called Warshal)
- Kruskal algorithm (using [Union and Find algorithm](https://courses.cs.duke.edu/cps100e/fall09/notes/UnionFind.pdf))
- Prims algorithm

### Repo has been archived and does not need anything new or any edits. These scripts might not be the best in terms of performance or implementation but are the easiest to understand for exams.
